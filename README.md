# ML
machine learning coding with bereket
Core Data Processing

pandas → Used to create, read, modify, and analyze tabular data (rows & columns).

numpy → Helps with mathematical operations, random number generation, arrays.

Visualization

matplotlib.pyplot → Basic graphs & plots.

seaborn → Pretty statistical visualizations (heatmaps, correlations, etc.).

Scikit-Learn (Traditional ML)

train_test_split → Splits data into training & testing sets.

StandardScaler → Normalizes numbers so models train better.

ColumnTransformer → Applies transformations to selected columns.

Pipeline → Chains preprocessing + model steps into one clean object.

RandomForestRegressor → Ensemble ML model for regression.

GradientBoostingRegressor → Another powerful boosting-based regressor.

Metrics → MAE, RMSE, R² to evaluate accuracy.

Joblib

joblib → Saves the trained model to a file.

PyTorch

torch → Main PyTorch library.

torch.nn → Layers (Linear, ReLU, etc.) for building neural networks.

torch.optim → Optimizers like Adam.

TensorDataset → Converts X & y into PyTorch training-ready datasets.

DataLoader → Loads data in batches for efficient training.
